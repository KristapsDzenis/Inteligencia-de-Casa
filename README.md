# IDC MQTT project

To run the project, follow these steps:

	1: Run the exec_all.py file
	2: If encountering errors or the webpage is not loading, make sure to install these packages:
		
		mqtt --> pip install paho-mqtt==1.6.1
		folium --> pip install folium
		webview --> pip install pywebview
		flask --> pip install flask
		
Make sure the paho-mqtt library is 1.6.1 and NOT 2.0.0 otherwise the code will not run.

Thank you all
